## 🚀 Quick Start / Installation

### Prerequisites
- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher
- Command-line interface (Terminal/Command Prompt)

### Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Nikshay-Jain/Java-Prog.git
cd Java-Prog
```

### Compile a Java Program
```bash
javac PROGRAM_NAME.java
```

### Run the Compiled Program
```bash
java PROGRAM_NAME
```

### Run Java Applets
```bash
appletviewer Applet1.html
```

---

## 🛠️ Usage

### Example 1: Calculate Factorial
```bash
# Compile the program
javac FACTORIAL.java

# Run the program
java FACTORIAL

# Input a number when prompted
# Output: Factorial of the entered number
```

### Example 2: ASCII Conversions
```bash
javac ASCII.java
java ASCII

# Converts characters to ASCII values and vice versa
```

### Example 3: Arithmetic & Geometric Progression
```bash
javac AP_GP.java
java AP_GP

# Calculate sum and nth term of AP/GP series
```

### Example 4: Sort Numbers (Ascending/Descending)
```bash
javac ASCENDING_DESCENDING.java
java ASCENDING_DESCENDING

# Enter numbers to sort in ascending or descending order
```

### Explore Object-Oriented Programming
```bash
cd AA
javac Data_Hiding1.java
java Data_Hiding1

# Demonstrates encapsulation and data hiding concepts
```
